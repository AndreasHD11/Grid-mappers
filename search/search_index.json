In general, the larger the tower and substation, the higher the voltage and therefore the greater the importance to the network. Priority should therefore be given to large, high-voltage infrastructure first. The easiest way to start mapping the transmission network is to find the location of new 'towers'. You can hardly go wrong with this and it will help you to familiarise yourself with the tool and the local network. Only map infrastructure that you can confidently classify using satellite or ground imagery.  Search for all \"Unfinished power lines\" in Osmose and check if you are able to find new towers at the end of the line. See the tools section.   Check if windparks, solar farms, and power plants are connected to the transmission grid.  The GEM per Country tool helps you to create a geojson file of all the power plants in a country.  Ensure all transmission substations are connected to the grid.   Check for news reports on new substations and transmission lines that have become operational in recent years. LLMs like ChatGPT allow you to search in the local language: \"Please search for news about transmission lines or substation recently opened in country A. Please use the official language of the country for your search\".   Search for new substation records and national substation records as a reference \"hint\" layer. LLMs like ChatGPT allow you to search in the local language: \"Please search for transmission lines or substation datasets in X. Please use the official language of the country for your search.\" For a curated list of datasets that may be useful, see Awesome Electric Grid Mapping List.</p>"},{"location":"awesome/","title":"Awesome list","text":"<p>A curated list of resources in the field of electric grid mapping to improve global open data coverage, harmonization and quality for a sustainable energy transition. </p> <p>This list includes national datasets and maps, information on electrical grid mapping in OSM, grid design basics, and other publications.

Example: As seen in the image to the right, the red polygon is a substation which is mapped by adding nodes that are connected to each other and tagges as a substation. </p> <p>3. Whilst having the OpenStreetMap layer activated, press the green Upload arrow. Avoid ignoring validation results. The only acceptable warning when uploading data is \"Possible missing line support node within power line\".</p> <p> How the bounding box currently works with our Overpass query:  Currently, the boundary of the country we want is associated to the \"country node\". This node tends to be where the name of the country is on the map or around the center of the country. If this node is within the bounding box then the query should work. To verify where the node is (useful if mapping regions for example), you can check on OpenStreetMap for the node's exact location.</p> <p>\u2b50 More info can be found at the repository</p>"},{"location":"tools/","title":"Useful Grid Mapping tools for OSM","text":""},{"location":"tools/#1-osmose-per-country","title":"1.
